# Vercel AI SDK useChat with Attachments Example

This example demonstrates how to use the [Apologist Fusion API chat completion endpoint](https://apologistproject.org/documentation/apologist-fusion/chat-completion) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and the `useChat` hook to create a chat interface that can send and receive messages.

To run the example locally you need to:

1. [Schedule a demo with The Apologist Project team](https://calendly.com/apologist-project/apologist-project-intro-full) to get a trial Agent and API keys.
3. Set the required environment variables as shown in the `.env.example` file, but in a new file called `.env`.
4. `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
5. `npm run dev` to launch the development server.
